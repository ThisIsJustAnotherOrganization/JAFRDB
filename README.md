# JAFRDB - Just Another Fuel Rats Dispatch Board  
  
## Introduction 
JAFRDB is a tool to help the dispatchers from the [FuelRats](https://fuelrats.com) help those in need more efficiently by tracking the status updates from those helping others.  
  
## The Config File
The config file contains a set of options, which all must be filled out, if you create this file manually. If it is missing on startup, it should be filled with the default values.
This file also contains your API token, which is unique to YOU and should never be shared with ANYONE. Neither me nor FuelRat staff will ask your for this. Treat it like your passwords. 
  
### For those messing with this file manually:
    current tokens are:  LogPathFr, ClientType, keyword, beep, LogPathRc, token and fontSize
    they must be separated by ": " from their value (like: keyword: ratsignal)
    ALL token names are CASE-SENSITIVE
    LogPathFr and LogPathRc MUST include the filename!
